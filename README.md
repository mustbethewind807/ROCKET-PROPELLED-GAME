# ROCKET PROPELLED GAME

### A GAME PROPELLED BY ROCKETS

Featuring non-existent EPICNESS.  
Currently in development, so don't expect the game to actually work.

### Compiling the game

First, download the game.  
If you want to clone the repo, clone it.  
Then, follow the instructions for your OS.

#### Linux

1. Install GCC if you don't have it installed.  
  The complete instructions can be found here https://gcc.gnu.org/install/
2. Compile the game. (I will provide a cmake file when I feel like it)
3. Run the game.

#### Windows

1. I really don't know what compliers there are for Windows, so find your own.
2. Compile the game with the compiler of your choice. (Again, I will add a cmake file later)
3. Run the game.
